I've decided to drop ghost and switch to jekyll/github pages to reduce my monthly expenses with my previous cloud provider. I looked into continuing with something like [Ghost on Gitub Pages](https://github.com/paladini/ghost-on-github-pages), but upgrades seem clunky and there are too many links that end up redirecting to `localhost`.

Quick write up of this blog for future me:

* This hosted on [github pages](https://pages.github.com/)
* With [SSL by Cloudflare](https://sheharyar.me/blog/free-ssl-for-github-pages-with-custom-domains/)
* Running the [Minimal Mistakes Theme](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/)
