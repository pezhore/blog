Quick list for home lab:

* Get a few CoreOS nodes deployed.
* Get [Chef](http://www.getchef.com/) installed/configured. (Maybe [littlechef](https://github.com/tobami/littlechef) would be useful?)
* Get [Salt](http://www.saltstack.com/) and/or maybe [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/).
* Look into [sslh](https://github.com/yrutschle/sslh).
* Look into Docker - perhaps to do some sort of OpenVPN/Proxy/etc?
